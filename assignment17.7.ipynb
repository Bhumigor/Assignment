    "A1. Boosting is a machine learning ensemble technique that combines the predictions of multiple weak learners (typically simple models) to create a strong learner. The primary goal of boosting is to improve the accuracy of classification or regression by giving more weight to examples that are difficult to classify or predict correctly. Boosting algorithms iteratively train weak learners, adjusting their weights based on previous errors, with the aim of focusing on the samples that are misclassified or have higher residuals."
