    "A1. The Random Forest Regressor is a machine learning algorithm used for regression tasks. It is an extension of the Random Forest algorithm, which is primarily used for classification. In regression, the Random Forest Regressor builds an ensemble of decision trees, where each tree is trained to predict a continuous target variable (e.g., predicting a numerical value like house prices or stock prices). It combines the predictions of multiple decision trees to make accurate and robust regression predictions."

    "- Feature Randomness: When splitting nodes in the trees, the algorithm considers only a random subset of features. This prevents individual trees from memorizing the training data.\n",
    "- Ensemble Averaging: By aggregating predictions from multiple trees, the ensemble tends to have a smoother prediction surface, reducing the impact of outliers and overfitting."

While the term \"Random Forest Regressor\" specifically refers to its use in regression tasks, the same algorithm can be adapted for classification by using a different loss function and appropriate decision criteria. In classification tasks, it is often referred to as the \"Random Forest Classifier.\" The key difference is that it predicts class labels (categories) instead of continuous values."
