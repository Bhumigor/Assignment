    "A1. Hierarchical clustering is a type of clustering algorithm that organizes data points into a hierarchy of clusters. It is different from other clustering techniques in that it creates a tree-like structure of clusters, also known as a dendrogram, where clusters at different levels of the hierarchy represent different levels of granularity. Hierarchical clustering can be agglomerative (bottom-up) or divisive (top-down), which sets it apart from methods like K-means."
