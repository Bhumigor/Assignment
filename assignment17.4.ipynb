    "A1. Bagging reduces overfitting in decision trees by introducing randomness and diversity in the training process. Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bagging involves creating multiple bootstrap samples (random samples with replacement) from the original training data.\n",
    "- Each bootstrap sample is used to train a separate decision tree, and these trees are typically deep and can overfit the training data.\n",
    "- By averaging (for regression) or majority voting (for classification) the predictions from these individual trees, bagging reduces the impact of individual tree's overfitting tendencies.\n",
    "- Additionally, since each tree is trained on a slightly different subset of data, the ensemble benefits from reduced variance and increased generalization."

    "A3. The choice of base learner can impact the bias-variance tradeoff in bagging as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Low-Bias Models: If you use base learners with low bias (models that can fit complex patterns), bagging can reduce their variance, making them more stable and less prone to overfitting. This improves the overall bias-variance tradeoff.\n",
    "- High-Bias Models: If you use base learners with high bias (models that make strong assumptions), bagging may not have as pronounced an effect on bias reduction. It can still reduce variance but might not improve the bias-variance tradeoff significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, bagging tends to have a more noticeable impact on reducing variance than bias, but its effectiveness depends on the inherent bias-variance characteristics of the base learners used."

    "\n",
    "Classification: In classification tasks, bagging typically involves training an ensemble of base classifiers (e.g., decision trees) on bootstrap samples. The final prediction is made by majority voting among the individual classifiers, and it helps reduce overfitting and improve classification accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression: In regression tasks, bagging similarly involves training an ensemble of base regression models (e.g., decision trees) on bootstrap samples. The final prediction is typically obtained by averaging the predictions from individual models. This reduces the impact of outliers and noise in the data, resulting in a more robust regression model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In both cases, the fundamental concept of bagging remains the same: it reduces variance and enhances model stability by combining multiple base models."
