    "A1. A projection is a transformation that maps a data point from a higher-dimensional space to a lower-dimensional subspace. In PCA (Principal Component Analysis), projections are used to represent the data in a new coordinate system, where the axes are the principal components (eigenvectors) of the data. These projections allow us to reduce the dimensionality of the data while preserving as much variance as possible."

The goal is to maximize the variance of the data along these principal components while ensuring they are orthogonal (uncorrelated). Mathematically, PCA solves the eigenvalue-eigenvector problem of the covariance matrix, and the principal components are the eigenvectors corresponding to the largest eigenvalues."

    "A9. PCA identifies principal components based on the variance in the data. If some dimensions have high variance while others have low variance, PCA will prioritize capturing the variation in the high-variance dimensions and may ignore or give less weight to the low-variance dimensions. As a result, low-variance dimensions may be represented less prominently in the principal components. This behavior can be beneficial in dimensionality reduction, as it allows the retention of important information while reducing the impact of less informative dimensions."
