    "A1. The \"curse of dimensionality\" refers to the challenges and issues that arise when working with high-dimensional data. In high-dimensional spaces, data points tend to become sparse, and the volume of the space increases exponentially with the number of dimensions. This leads to problems such as increased computational complexity and difficulties in data analysis and visualization. Dimensionality reduction is important in machine learning because it aims to mitigate these issues by reducing the number of features or dimensions while preserving meaningful information."

Feature selection methods can be categorized into three types:\n",
