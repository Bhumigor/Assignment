Complete case analysis reduces the sample size and may introduce bias if the missing data are not missing completely at random. Imputation methods assume that missing data are missing at random, and the imputed values may not accurately reflect the true underlying values. Multiple imputation can provide more reliable estimates but requires careful consideration of the imputation model and assumptions. Using different methods can lead to different conclusions about the significance of the effects and may impact the validity of the results. It is essential to handle missing data appropriately and consider the potential impact of the chosen method on the study conclusions."
