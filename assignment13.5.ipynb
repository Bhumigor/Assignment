    "A1. Data encoding is the process of converting categorical data into a numerical format that can be used by machine       learning algorithms. In data science, this process is essential because most machine learning algorithms work with numerical data, and categorical data, which consists of labels or categories, cannot be directly used as input. Data encoding helps in making the data suitable for analysis and modeling."
