    "A1. Time-dependent seasonal components refer to seasonal patterns in a time series that change over time. Unlike static seasonal patterns, which remain consistent in magnitude and frequency, time-dependent seasonal components can vary in their impact on the time series as time progresses. For instance, the amplitude of seasonal fluctuations might increase or decrease, or the seasonal cycle might shift due to underlying changes in the system."
