    "A1. Bayes' theorem, named after Thomas Bayes, is a fundamental theorem in probability theory and statistics. It describes how to update or revise the probability for a hypothesis (an event or proposition) based on new evidence or information. In essence, it helps us calculate the probability of a hypothesis being true given our prior beliefs and any new data."
