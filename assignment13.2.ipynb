    "Overfitting: Overfitting occurs when a machine learning model learns the training data too well, capturing noise and random fluctuations in the data instead of generalizing to unseen data. As a result, the model performs excellently on the training data but fails to perform well on new, unseen data (test data). Consequences include poor generalization, reduced model performance on real-world data, and increased sensitivity to noise.\n",
