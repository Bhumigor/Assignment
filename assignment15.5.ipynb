    "A1.Elastic Net Regression is a linear regression technique that combines L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization penalties to overcome some of the limitations of these individual techniques. In traditional linear regression, the objective is to minimize the sum of squared residuals. Elastic Net adds two regularization terms to this objective function:\n",
    "\n",
    "L1 regularization (Lasso): This term adds the absolute values of the coefficients as a penalty. It encourages sparsity in the model by driving some coefficients to exactly zero, effectively performing feature selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "L2 regularization (Ridge): This term adds the squares of the coefficients as a penalty. It helps to prevent multicollinearity and keeps all features in the model, although some may have small weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Elastic Net combines these two penalties by introducing two hyperparameters, alpha (α) and lambda (λ), to control the balance between L1 and L2 regularization. By tuning these hyperparameters, you can control the degree of sparsity in the model.\n"

You can perform a grid search over a range of alpha and lambda values, and for each combination, evaluate the model's performance using a validation set or cross-validation. The combination of alpha and lambda that results in the best model performance (e.g., lowest mean squared error or highest R-squared) on the validation data is considered the optimal choice."

The purpose of pickling a model in machine learning is to serialize and save a trained model to a file so that it can be easily stored, transported, or used in the future without needing to retrain it. Pickling allows you to save the model's parameters, configuration, and any necessary preprocessing steps. This is particularly useful when you want to deploy a machine learning model in a production environment, share it with others, or use it for batch processing without the overhead of retraining the model each time it's needed."
