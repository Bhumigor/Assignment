    "A1. Clustering algorithms are used to group similar data points together based on certain similarity criteria. Some common types of clustering algorithms and their differences include:\n",
    "- K-Means Clustering: This is a centroid-based algorithm where each cluster is represented by the mean (centroid) of its data points. It assumes that clusters are spherical, equally sized, and have similar densities.\n",
    "- Hierarchical Clustering: This method creates a hierarchy of clusters by iteratively merging or splitting existing clusters. It doesn't require specifying the number of clusters in advance and can be visualized as a dendrogram.\n",
    "- DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise): DBSCAN defines clusters as dense regions separated by sparser regions. It can find clusters of arbitrary shapes and sizes.\n",
    "- Agglomerative vs. Divisive Clustering: These are hierarchical clustering approaches. Agglomerative starts with individual data points as clusters and merges them, while divisive starts with all data points in one cluster and splits them.\n",
    "- Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM): GMM assumes that data points are generated from a mixture of several Gaussian distributions. It can model clusters with different shapes and sizes and provide probabilistic cluster assignments.\n",
    "- Spectral Clustering: Spectral clustering uses the spectrum of the Laplacian matrix of a similarity graph to partition data into clusters. It's effective for non-convex clusters.\n",
    "- Density-Based Clustering: Besides DBSCAN, there are other density-based methods like OPTICS (Ordering Points To Identify Cluster Structure) and Mean Shift.\n",
    "- Fuzzy Clustering: Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) assigns data points to clusters with degrees of membership rather than strict assignments.\n",
    "- Self-Organizing Maps (SOM): SOM is an unsupervised neural network technique that maps high-dimensional data into a low-dimensional grid while preserving topological relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "These algorithms differ in terms of how they define clusters (e.g., centroids, density, connectivity), how they handle noise and outliers, whether they require specifying the number of clusters, and their sensitivity to initialization and hyperparameters."

    "2. Assignment: Assign each data point to the nearest centroid. This step creates K clusters based on proximity.\n",
    "3. Update Centroids: Recalculate the centroids of the clusters as the mean of the data points in each cluster.\n",
