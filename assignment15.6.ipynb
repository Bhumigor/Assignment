    "\n",
    "Cloud Hosting: Cloud hosting uses virtualization and cloud infrastructure provided by a cloud service provider (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP). It offers scalability, flexibility, and on-demand resource allocation. You can easily provision and manage resources through a web portal or API, and you pay for what you use."
