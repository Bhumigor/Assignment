    "A1. KNN stands for \"k-nearest neighbors.\" It's a simple and versatile machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. In KNN, an object is classified by a majority vote of its k nearest neighbors. It works based on the principle that objects that are similar are likely to be in the same class or have similar values."

    "A2. The choice of the value of k in KNN is crucial and can significantly impact the model's performance. A smaller value of k (e.g., 1 or 3) can make the model sensitive to noise, while a larger value of k can make the model overly biased. To choose an appropriate value for k, you can use techniques like cross-validation or grid search to find the value that yields the best performance on your dataset."

As the number of dimensions (features) increases, the distance between data points becomes less meaningful, and KNN may perform poorly. This is because points in high-dimensional space tend to be far apart, and the nearest neighbors may not be truly representative. Techniques such as dimensionality reduction or feature selection can help mitigate this issue."
